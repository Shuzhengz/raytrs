software raytracing engine in rust

made for fun and practice with rust

in active development



usage:

-h to show help

-o [filename.png] to specify output file (defaults to out.png)

-s [filename.json] to specify scene file, example can be found in example\_scene/scene.json



be cautioned that I havent added any error handling yet, so it panics at basically anything.
will fix soon.
