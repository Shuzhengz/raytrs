software raytracing engine in rust

made for fun and practice with rust

in active development

Edit scn.rs to change the objects in the scene.
By default it will search for file 'teapot1.obj' in current directory, so make sure to run from repo folder, otherwise it won't find the file and panic.
I realize this is dumb and will change eventually, when I add command line argument parsing :P
